>You can only learn how to code by coding  

A repository on various OOP applications in Python  
I decided to put into practice what I learnt in Object Oriented Programming as it applies to Python  
I drew inspiration for this repository from *[Python OOP Practice Projects](https://github.com/chenmingxue/Python_PracticeProjects)*  
  
~~If you are also trying to learn Object Oriented Programming for Python, [Corey Schafer](https://coreyms.com/development/python/python-oop-tutorials-complete-series) has arguably the best videos for learning OOP~~.  
**Scratch that, [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5) has the best videos for learning Python and it is absolutely free!**
